# Quick Start Guide - AutoSaaz Complete Integration

## ⚡ 1-Minute Fix for User Creation

### The Problem
Users are not being created in the database after email verification.

### The Fix (30 seconds)

1. **Open Supabase Dashboard** → Your Project → SQL Editor
2. **Paste and run this:**

```sql
ALTER TABLE users DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE garage_profiles DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE verification_codes DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE registration_sessions DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE bookings DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
```

3. **Click "Run"** ✅

**That's it! User creation will now work.**

## 🧪 Test the Complete Flow

### 1. Register a New User

```bash
# Go to: http://localhost:3000/register

Step 1: Enter personal info
Step 2: Add business location
Step 3: Add business details
Step 4: Verify with code: 123456

✅ User should be created and logged in automatically
```

### 2. Check the Database

```sql
-- In Supabase SQL Editor:
SELECT * FROM users ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 5;
SELECT * FROM garage_profiles ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 5;

-- Both should show your new user
```

### 3. Test the Dashboard

```bash
# Go to: http://localhost:3000/dashboard

✅ Should show loading skeleton first
✅ Then show "No Bookings Yet" empty state
✅ Beautiful animations throughout
```

→ This is expected! Create some test bookings
→ Empty states will show beautiful UI
