## Backend Response (Expected)

      "email": "john@example.com",
      "phoneNumber": "+971501234567",

  }
}
```

## Console Logs (Enhanced)

OTP Code: 647197
Response Status: 200
Response OK: true
Response Data: { success: true, data: { ... } }
✅ Access token saved
✅ Refresh token saved
✅ User data saved
=== STEP 4 VERIFICATION SUCCESS ===
```

On error:
```
=== STEP 4 VERIFICATION ERROR ===
Error Type: TypeError
Error Message: Invalid verification code
Error Stack: ...
```

## Testing Instructions

### 1. Test Locally
```bash
npm start
```

Navigate to: `http://localhost:3000/register`

Complete all 4 steps:
1. Enter personal info → Next
2. Enter location → Next
3. Enter business details → Next (OTP sent)
4. Enter OTP code → Verify Code
5. Should auto-login and redirect to dashboard

### 2. Test on Vercel
After Vercel redeploys (automatic from push), test at:
`https://auto-saaz-garage-client.vercel.app/register`

### 3. Verify API Calls
Open browser DevTools (F12) → Console tab

You should see:
- `=== STEP 1 REGISTRATION START ===`
- `=== STEP 4 VERIFICATION START ===`
- Detailed request/response logs

## What's Still Needed

### 1. Backend CORS Configuration ⚠️
The backend still needs to add CORS headers to allow requests from your frontend domain.

**Required CORS headers:**
```
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://auto-saaz-garage-client.vercel.app
Access-Control-Allow-Methods: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, OPTIONS
Access-Control-Allow-Headers: Content-Type, Authorization
Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true
```

See `CORS_ISSUE_FIX.md` for implementation details.

### 2. Verify Backend URL ⚠️
Make sure your Vercel environment variable points to the correct backend:
- Check if it's `auto-saaz-server.onrender.com` (with hyphen)
- Or `autosaaz-server.onrender.com` (no hyphen)

See `BACKEND_URL_FIX.md` for testing instructions.

## Summary

✅ **Password fields removed** - verification now only requires OTP code  
✅ **API aligned with backend** - request body matches backend expectations  
✅ **Enhanced logging** - detailed console output for debugging  
✅ **Committed and pushed** - changes deployed to GitHub  
⏳ **Waiting for Vercel redeploy** - will auto-deploy from push  
⚠️ **CORS fix still needed** - backend team must add CORS configuration  

---

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Wait for Vercel to redeploy (automatic)
2. ⚠️ Backend team: Add CORS configuration (see CORS_ISSUE_FIX.md)
3. ⚠️ Verify backend URL is correct (see BACKEND_URL_FIX.md)
4. ✅ Test registration flow end-to-end
5. ✅ Verify OTP verification works without password
