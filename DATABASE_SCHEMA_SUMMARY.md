## 🎯 Schema Highlights

### "Garage" Integration
The schema extensively uses "garage" terminology as requested:
- ✅ `garages` table (central business entity)
- ✅ `garage_staff` table
- ✅ `garage_services` table
- ✅ `garage_id` foreign keys throughout
- ✅ Views: `v_garage_active_appointments`, `v_garage_dashboard_stats`
- ✅ Indexes: `idx_garage_*` naming convention
- ✅ RLS policies for garage data isolation

### Multi-Platform Support
- ✅ **Garage Client**: Manage appointments, inspections, services, staff
- ✅ **Admin Dashboard**: User management, garage verification, disputes
- ✅ **Mobile App**: Customer bookings, payments, chat, vehicles

### UAE-Specific Features
- ✅ Phone numbers: +971XXXXXXXXX format validation
- ✅ Emirates: State/emirate field for location
- ✅ Trade License: Required for garage registration
- ✅ VAT Certification: Optional business field
- ✅ Emirates ID: File upload URL storage
- ✅ Currency: AED (Arab Emirates Dirham)

## 📊 Database Statistics

| Category | Count |
|----------|-------|
| **Tables** | 18 |

## 🚀 Next Steps

### 1. Database Setup
```bash
# Option A: PostgreSQL
psql -U your_username -d autosaaz_db -f DATABASE_SCHEMA.sql

# Option B: Supabase
# Copy DATABASE_SCHEMA.sql content to Supabase SQL Editor and run
```

### 2. Populate Sample Data
```sql
-- Run sample data queries from DATABASE_SETUP_GUIDE.md
-- Create test users, garages, services, appointments
```

### 3. Update Backend API
The schema matches your current API structure:
- ✅ Registration endpoints (step1/2/3)
- ✅ Authentication endpoints
- ✅ Appointments/bookings endpoints
- ✅ Inspections endpoints
- ✅ Resolution center endpoints

### 4. Test End-to-End
- Test registration flow (all 3 steps + verification)
- Test garage service management
- Test appointment booking and confirmation
- Test inspection creation and completion
- Test payment processing
- Test dispute resolution

---

## 🔐 Security Features Implemented

1. **Row Level Security (RLS)**
   - Garages can only access their own data
   - Customers can only access their own data
   - Implemented via Supabase policies

2. **Audit Logging**
   - All critical operations logged
   - IP address tracking
   - Before/after values stored

3. **Password Security**
   - Bcrypt hashing (store only hashes)
   - Password reset with expiring tokens
   - Account locking after failed attempts

4. **Soft Deletes**
   - Users table has `deleted_at` field
   - Data preserved for audit purposes
   - Filtered via WHERE clause

---

## 📝 Sample Queries

### Get Garage Dashboard Statistics
```sql
SELECT * FROM v_garage_dashboard_stats
WHERE garage_id = 'your-garage-uuid';
```

### Get Pending Appointments
```sql
SELECT * FROM v_garage_active_appointments
WHERE garage_id = 'your-garage-uuid'
    AND status = 'pending'
ORDER BY appointment_datetime;
```

### Get Customer Booking History
```sql
SELECT * FROM v_customer_booking_history
WHERE customer_id = 'your-customer-uuid'
ORDER BY appointment_datetime DESC
LIMIT 20;
```

## 🔄 Migration Path

If you have existing data:

1. **Export existing data** from current database
2. **Run new schema** in fresh database
3. **Create migration scripts** to transform old data to new format
4. **Test in staging** environment
5. **Execute production migration** during maintenance window
6. **Verify data integrity** post-migration
