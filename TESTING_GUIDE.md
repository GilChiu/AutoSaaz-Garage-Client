# Quick Start - Testing Registration Flow

## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. Restart Development Server
The `.env` file was updated to point to the real backend API. You need to restart the dev server for changes to take effect.

```powershell
# Stop the current server (Ctrl+C in the terminal)
# Then restart:
npm start
```

### 2. Open the Application
Navigate to: `http://localhost:3000/register`

## üîç What to Check

### Browser DevTools (F12)

#### Console Tab
Look for API calls and responses:
- Step 1: `POST /api/garage/register/step-1` ‚Üí sessionId
- Step 2: `POST /api/garage/register/step-2` ‚Üí success
- Step 3: `POST /api/garage/register/step-3` ‚Üí OTP sent
- Step 4: `POST /api/garage/register/verify` ‚Üí tokens

#### Network Tab
- Filter by `Fetch/XHR`
- Watch for `200 OK` responses
- Check for any `400` or `500` errors

#### Application Tab (localStorage)
After Step 1:
```
registrationSessionId: "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000"
sessionExpiresAt: "2024-01-15T12:00:00Z"
```

After Step 4 (successful):
```
accessToken: "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIs..."
refreshToken: "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIs..."
```

Registration session should be cleared:
```
registrationSessionId: (removed)
sessionExpiresAt: (removed)
```

## üêõ Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "Session expired" error on Step 2
**Cause**: `sessionId` not found in localStorage  
**Solution**: 
- Check Step 1 completed successfully
- Check browser console for errors in Step 1
- Try registering again from Step 1

### Issue: OTP not received
**Cause**: Email/phone number might be invalid  
**Solution**: 
- Check email spam folder
- Verify phone number is correct UAE format
- Check backend logs for email/SMS sending errors

### Issue: "Invalid verification code"
**Cause**: OTP code is wrong or expired  
**Solution**: 
- Double-check the code from email/SMS
- Click "Resend Code" to get a new code
- Codes typically expire after 10 minutes

### Issue: Password validation error
**Cause**: Password doesn't meet requirements  
**Solution**: 
- Use at least 8 characters
- Include: uppercase (A-Z), lowercase (a-z), number (0-9), special (!@#$%^&*)
- Example: `SecurePass123!`

### Issue: Can't upload Emirates ID
**Cause**: File upload is currently a placeholder  
**Solution**: 
- Upload any PDF or image file
- It will use a placeholder URL
- Real file upload needs backend endpoint (see TODO in REGISTRATION_API_INTEGRATION.md)

### Issue: Not redirected to dashboard after Step 4
**Cause**: AuthContext might not be set up correctly  
**Solution**: 
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify tokens are saved to localStorage
- Check AuthContext.js for `login` function

## üìä Password Strength Meter Test

Try different passwords and check the strength indicator:

| Password | Strength | Reason |
|----------|----------|--------|
| `pass` | Weak | Too short |
| `password` | Weak | No uppercase, number, special char |
| `Password1` | Medium | Missing special character |
| `Pass1!` | Medium | Less than 8 characters |
| `Password123!` | Strong | Meets all requirements |
| `SecureP@ssw0rd` | Strong | 12+ chars, all requirements |

## üéØ Success Criteria

Registration is working correctly if:
- ‚úÖ All 4 steps complete without errors
- ‚úÖ OTP received via email/SMS
- ‚úÖ User automatically logged in after Step 4
- ‚úÖ User redirected to `/dashboard`
- ‚úÖ JWT tokens saved to localStorage
- ‚úÖ Registration session cleared from localStorage
- ‚úÖ User can access protected routes

## üìù Next Steps After Testing

Once registration works:
1. **Implement file upload** for Emirates ID (see `RegisterPage3.jsx` TODO)
2. **Update AuthContext** to use new token-based authentication
3. **Add session timer UI** to show remaining time
4. **Add OTP resend cooldown** (60-second delay)
5. **Test on mobile devices** for responsive design
